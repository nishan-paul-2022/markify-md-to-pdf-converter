## 1. Welcome to Markify
Markify is an advanced Markdown-to-PDF ecosystem designed for academics and professionals. It provides a seamless transition from raw Markdown to production-ready academic reports.

---

## 2. Editor Page: Your Workspace
The Editor page is your command center for content creation.

### **2.1 File Explorer & Navigation**
The sidebar allows you to manage multiple files. You can create subfolders to keep your research and final drafts organized. All content is auto-saved locally.

### **2.2 Real-time Search & Selection**
Instantly find any file using the search bar. Use **Selection Mode** (the checkbox icon) to select multiple files for batch deletion, keeping your workspace clean.

### **2.3 Global Reset System**
The **Reset Button** in the sidebar is a safety feature. Clicking it will purge all your local drafts and restore these original instruction guides to the editor.

## 3. Converter Page: Production Engine
The Converter page is where your markdown files are transformed into high-fidelity A4 PDFs.

### **3.1 Multi-Mode Uploading**
You can upload individual `.md` files, entire folder structures, or even a single `.zip` archive. Markify handles the extraction and mapping automatically.

### **3.2 Live Preview & Zoom Scale**
Inspect your document before downloading. The live preview represents exact A4 dimensions. Use the **Zoom Slider** (50% to 200%) to perform detailed quality checks on fine text and diagrams.

### **3.3 Sorting & Organization**
Arrange your files using the sort dropdown. You can sort by **Name**, **File Size**, or **Upload Time** to ensure your multi-file projects are combined in the correct sequence.

### **3.4 Final PDF Export**
Once you are satisfied with the preview, the **Download Button** generates a professional PDF with embedded links, graphics, and high-quality typography.

## 4. Mastering Markdown Syntax
To unlock the full potential of Markify, use these specialized syntax features.

### **4.1 The Individual Landing Page**
Markify can **automatically create a cover page** for you! Just start your file with `# Landing Page` followed by a simple list like this:
- `University`, `Program`, `Title`, `Subtitle`, `Course`, `Name`, `Roll No`, `Reg. No`, `Batch`, `Submission Date`.

The application scans these keywords and places them into a beautiful, professional layout at the very beginning of your PDF. Since this is an **Individual Submission**, it is designed to highlight your details clearly.

### **4.2 Navigational Table of Contents**
Creating a `# Table of Contents` section with internal links generates a clickable TOC in the final PDF. For example: `[Welcome](#1-welcome-to-markify)`.

### **4.3 Explicit Page Breaks (\pagebreak)**
The `\pagebreak` tag is a crucial feature. It forces the PDF generator to start a new page immediately, allowing you to perfectly separate your cover, TOC, and chapters.

### **4.4 Mermaid Diagrams**
Visualize complex logic without external images using Mermaid blocks:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Markdown] --> B{Markify Engine}
    B --> C[A4 Live Preview]
    C --> D[PDF Download]
```
